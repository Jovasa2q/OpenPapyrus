 * <pre>
 *       Cell for double-linked lists
 *
 *       This allows composition of a list of cells with
 *           prev, next and data pointers.  Generic data
 *           structures hang on the list cell data pointers.
 *
 *       The list is not circular because that would add much
 *           complexity in traversing the list under general
 *           conditions where list cells can be added and removed.
 *           The only disadvantage of not having the head point to
 *           the last cell is that the list must be traversed to
 *           find its tail.  However, this traversal is fast, and
 *           the listRemoveFromTail() function updates the tail
 *           so there is no searching overhead with repeated use.
 *
 *       The list macros are used to run through a list, and their
 *       use is encouraged.  They are invoked, e.g., as
 *
 *             DLLIST  *head, *elem;
 *             ...
 *             L_BEGIN_LIST_FORWARD(head, elem)
 *                 <do something with elem and/or elem->data >
 *             L_END_LIST
 * </pre>
